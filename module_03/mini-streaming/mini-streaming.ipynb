    "# 🧩 Mini-Lab: Streaming Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2: LLM Core Concepts** | **Duration: ~20 min** | **Type: Mini-Lab**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this mini-lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand** how autoregressive generation works (token-by-token)\n",
    "2. **Understand** how streaming differs from regular API responses\n",
    "3. **Implement** streaming with OpenAI's API\n",
    "4. **Process** tokens as they arrive in real-time\n",
    "5. **Build** interactive user experiences with streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| Autoregressive Generation | LLMs generate text one token at a time, each depending on previous tokens |\n",
    "| Streaming | Receiving tokens incrementally as they're generated |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 How LLMs Generate Text: Autoregressive Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLMs generate text one token at a time.** This is called **autoregressive generation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: \"The capital of France is\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Model predicts → \"Paris\" (based on prompt)\n",
    "Step 2: Model predicts → \".\" (based on prompt + \"Paris\")\n",
    "Step 3: Model predicts → \"\\n\" (based on prompt + \"Paris\" + \".\")\n",
    "...and so on until a stop condition is met\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each token depends on ALL previous tokens** - the model \"reads\" everything before predicting the next word\n",
    "2. **Generation is sequential** - you can't generate token 5 before tokens 1-4\n",
    "3. **This is why streaming is possible** - we can send each token as it's generated\n",
    "4. **This is why context matters** - earlier tokens influence all later predictions\n",

       "- **Benefit**: Enhances maintainability and allows for easier debugging and testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n",
       "- **Definition**: Avoid duplication of code and logic.\n",
       "- **Benefit**: Reduces redundancy, minimizes errors, and makes changes easier to implement across the codebase.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)\n",
       "- **Definition**: Design systems in the simplest way possible; avoid over-complication.\n",

       "## 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)\n",

       "\n",
       "## 5. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
       "- **Definition**: A module or class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.\n",
       "- **Benefit**: Enhances code clarity and minimizes the impact of changes.\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Streaming Benefits**\n",
    "   - Faster perceived response time\n",
    "   - Better user experience\n",
    "   - Ability to process/stop early\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implementation**\n",
    "   - Set `stream=True` in API call\n",
    "   - Iterate over chunks\n",
    "   - Access content via `chunk.choices[0].delta.content`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Common Patterns**\n",
    "   - Live markdown rendering\n",
    "   - Word/phrase detection\n",
    "   - Early termination\n",
    "   - Token counting with `stream_options`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Practices**\n",
    "   - Always use `flush=True` when printing\n",
    "   - Handle `None` content in chunks\n",
    "   - Track both chunks and content\n",
