        "\n",
        "- **Collects** live data from a news website using a single reusable scraper function\n",
        "- **Processes** it with two different LLMs (OpenAI and Claude)\n",

        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **API Key Setup** — Both OpenAI and Anthropic follow the same pattern: sign up, add payment, create key, save to `.env`\n",
        "2. **Client Initialization** — Both clients auto-read API keys from environment variables\n",
        "3. **Web Scraping** — `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` is all you need for simple HTML sites. One function with a URL and CSS selector can scrape many different websites.\n",
        "4. **Multi-Model Usage** — Different models can serve different roles (summarization vs. classification)\n",
        "5. **Real-World Pattern** — Data Collection, then AI Processing, then Useful Output is a core AI engineering workflow\n",
        "\n",

        "- **mini-ollama-setup**: Set up local LLMs with Ollama (free, private, no API key needed)\n",
